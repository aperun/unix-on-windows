# UNIX on Windows
Bringing UNIX utilities to native Windows

## Purpose {#purpose}
  Microsoft has begun a journey into the open source world and naturally
    in doing so added modules like a Linux subsystem to Windows.  Sadly,
    this does not assist the everyday programmer or IT hobbyist in
    achieving their goals of having a personal environment in which to
    develop ideas, new and old.
    
  This project aims to bring UNIX (Linux and *BSD alike) utilities to
    the Windows platform natively so that users of the ported software
    can use Windows utilities along side without layers of abstraction to
    slow/complicate the process.
